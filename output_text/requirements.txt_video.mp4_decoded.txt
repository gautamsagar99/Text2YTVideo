You will be prompted for a key during both encoding and decoding.
The binary data is XOR-encrypted with your key before storing as video, and decrypted with the same key when decoding.
This ensures only someone with the correct key can recover the original text from the video. Let me know if you want to use a stronger encryption method or need further features!
